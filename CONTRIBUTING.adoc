== How to create a PR

. Fork this repository
. create a feature branch which has the name `MemeforceHunt-#iss`. +
Example: `MemeforceHunt-1` using `git checkout -b MemeforceHunt-1`.
. Develop
. Create some junit tests.
Keep them SIMPLE. If you set up too many mocks, you are doing something wrong.
. When you are done, execute `mvn clean verify` before commiting. +
Pay attention to checkstyle checks, tests and
. Commit and push
. Create pull request.

== Commit and PR rules

* Your code *must* have code coverage on new and important routines.
* Your code *must* pass the checkstyle and enforcer validation.
* You *must* have run `mvn clean verify -Pdocs,run-its` before creating the pull request.
* You *must* license the code under Apache License v2.0.

== How to develop

* Make sure your IDE picks up the checkstyle rules from `build/checkstyle.xml`.
* Do not change any lines which you did not need to touch (e.g. adding or removing a modifier).
* Do not add or remove whitespace if not needed.
* Do not use `else`.
If you encounter an else, refactor out into a method which does this: +

[source,java]
----
class SomeClass {
  void method() {
    if (false /*special condition*/) {
      specialLogic();

      return;
    }

    // always execute 'normal' logic without indentation.
    normalLogic();
  }
}
----

== Testing

If you want to test if the code still works, load up a patched game and start in Link's house.
Enter this code: `01E9BC=6C`.

If you open the house chest, you should see a Memeforce piece.
