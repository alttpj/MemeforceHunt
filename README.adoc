This application can be used to alter the imagery in an ALttPR game file for the Triforce Piece item.

== How it works

This tool will load a specific sprite map which can be seen here:

.Spritemap containing the memforce hunt sprite
[#img-spritemap]
image::.github/spritemap.png[Spritemap]

It will replace the second last item in the lower row (the mushroom in the image).

The sprite consists of four tiles, with each tile being a standard item tile (8x8px, 3bpp).
Indexes (starting from 0) are: 44, 45, 60, 61.
