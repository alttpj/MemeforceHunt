= Installing

This file includes instructions on how to compile and install this tool.

== Prerequisites

* Java SDK version 16 or higher.

I can highly recommend link:https://github.com/shyiko/jabba[Jabba] for downloading and/or managing your java version.

You can also add the JDKs into your link:https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-using-toolchains.html[Toolchain file]
if you do not want to switch back and forth between JDKs.

*Note*: This is just a compile time dependency.
The bytecode will be Java 16 compatible due to the use of the `-release=16` switch.

== Installing to your local repository

* On Linux and MacOS: +
`./mvnw clean install`

* On Windows: +
`mvnw.cmd clean install`

If the installation was successful, you can now use this tool as described in the link:README.adoc#how-to-use[README].

== Dependencies

=== Compile & Runtime dependencies

* *javafx*
* *javafx metro* theme
* *picocli* for the CLI option parsing
* *Jackson* for parsing the sprite library.
* (soon): *alttpj-library* for creating your own sprites.

=== Test dependencies

This tool needs junit-jupiter and hamcrest-library for executing tests.
Thus, you need those libraries installed _or_ a working internet connection.
